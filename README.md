# Lab 1 - *Tumblr-Feed*

**Tumblr-Feed** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [x] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [x] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
    1. How about loading first 10 photos and then if I want 10 more photos I just scroll up and get 10 more photos.
    2. When clicked on a picture I should go to a different controller and show more info about it. 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. The placeholder image, why this time in the lab as opposed to the assignment Flix, my image was cut off.
2. I would like to talk about the load more photos at the end of the scrolling. 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Lab was pretty much same as the previous assignment, basically everything I did before I implemented here. I had no issues other than the placeholder image was not fitting the UIImageView properly.
